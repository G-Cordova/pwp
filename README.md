Personal Website Project

### Milestone 1 Feedback
Nice work outlining a general direction for your portfolio website. You've got a good start here, and the Purpose, Audience, Goal and Persona are thoughtfully done. 

Creating a site that is designed to drive sales is a very specific aim - so keep it in mind that the overall goal that you have stated here is to sell your services to prospective clients, and your content strategy and UI design should be created with this goal in mind. The more you understand your prospective clients and their market demographics, the better - but this is getting into business and marketing territory. On the other hand, a site that you'd design and create to impress _employers_ or _professional peers_ would probably be pretty different - generally speaking. And as a freelancer it's very important to understand the difference! Just some ideas to keep in mind. Daniel Heron can be of help here too, and I look forward to seeing your content and design choices take shape in the next phase.

**There are a couple of technical issues that need to be fixed - directory structure and your .gitignore. See Edits &amp; Suggestions below for more details.** Otherwise your code looks great - nice work.

Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You are now clear to begin work on Milestone 2&alpha;.

#### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Directory structure needs to be fixed: place your `/documentation` directory inside a directory named `/public_html`. See instructions here: https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-one/
- Be sure to add `/vendor` to your .gitignore

### Milestone 2a Feedback
The wireframes you have here are a good start - but they are incomplete. **I don't see a contact form or a content strategy, and the project isn't set up correctly according to the instructions.** Please read the [Milestone 2a Documentation](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two/) and add a Content Strategy and set the project up correctly by 8:00am Wed 5/9 and I'll bump your grade up to [Tier II](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). Please look at the [Sample Milestones](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/example/) for an example of our expectations for this project.

Unfortunately because this Milestone is incomplete - it only qualifies for [Tier I](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). Please complete the requirements and circle back with me before beginning development on PWP. 

### PWP Final Feedback
Nice work on a simple and effective website. There is plenty of room to keep working on and refining this - keep practicing and challenging yourself!

*Code Base*: Overall your code looks good. There's an extra opening `<div>` on line 41 that should be deleted. Your `/documentation` directory also should be moved inside `/public_html` (or even deleted if you like).

*Git Commits*: Nice work with Git - your commit/push history is good here.

*Mobile-First Responsiveness*: I've tested your page using devtools, Chrome on Linux, and Chrome & Firefox on Android, and your layout responds well across these platforms.

*Design, Content, &amp; Overall Presentation*: You've relied on the built-in Bootstrap default styling, and it works well here for the most part. There is definitely room for you to experiment and refine the look and feel here for a more artistic polish - so keep challenging yourself. Here are a few ideas:
- The white text on the image up top is very hard to read. Try darkening the image, or using a text shadow to make it stand out a bit more. You could even put a transparent background color behind the text as well.
- There is a gap at the bottom of the footer. This is being caused by margin from the `<p>` tag inside. Swap that for a `<div>` and this should solve your problem.
- Maybe try a fancy typeface and some headings?
- Consider adding the `target="_blank"` attribute to your links to have them open in a new tab.

*Contact Form*: This appears to work fine from my end - did you recieve my test message?

Nice work - but keep challenging yourself further. Your PWP passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). Your cumulative PWP score including all Milestones is 28/40 points (70%).

- Milestone 1 - 20%: Tier III 30(0.2) = 6
- Milestone 2a - 20%: Tier II 20(0.2) = 4
- Milestone 2b - 10%: Tier III 30(0.1) = 3
- Milestone 3 - 50%: Tier III 30(0.5) = 15

#### Suggestions
- We didn't discuss favicons, but you might want to consider adding one. Have a look at this tool which helps render multiple versions for cross-platform  support: https://realfavicongenerator.net/
