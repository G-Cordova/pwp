Personal Website Project

### Milestone 1 Feedback
Nice work outlining a general direction for your portfolio website. You've got a good start here, and the Purpose, Audience, Goal and Persona are thoughtfully done. 

Creating a site that is designed to drive sales is a very specific aim - so keep it in mind that the overall goal that you have stated here is to sell your services to prospective clients, and your content strategy and UI design should be created with this goal in mind. The more you understand your prospective clients and their market demographics, the better - but this is getting into business and marketing territory. On the other hand, a site that you'd design and create to impress _employers_ or _professional peers_ would probably be pretty different - generally speaking. And as a freelancer it's very important to understand the difference! Just some ideas to keep in mind. Daniel Heron can be of help here too, and I look forward to seeing your content and design choices take shape in the next phase.

**There are a couple of technical issues that need to be fixed - directory structure and your .gitignore. See Edits &amp; Suggestions below for more details.** Otherwise your code looks great - nice work.

Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You are now clear to begin work on Milestone 2&alpha;.

#### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Directory structure needs to be fixed: place your `/documentation` directory inside a directory named `/public_html`. See instructions here: https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-one/
- Be sure to add `/vendor` to your .gitignore
