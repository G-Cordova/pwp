<h2>Content Strategy</h2>
		<p>
			The stradegy of my site is to give an oversight of my portfolio and a way to contact me. Both the mobile and desktop versions will have links to contact me through email, linkedin, twitter, and github The versions will display 2-3 of my portfolio projects and links. On mobile version, the images will stack vertically on top of each other. Both versions will also have a contact link that will direct you to the bottom of the page to the contact form. The site will also have a captcha to avoid bots.
